# Gstore_Revenu

The 80/20 rule has proven true for many businessesâ€“only a small percentage of customers produce most of the revenue. As such, marketing teams are challenged to make appropriate investments in promotional strategies.
In this Kaggle competition, we are challenged to analyze Google store data set and try to predict the revenue per customer.
In this notebook, I present some simple steps for feature exploration and visualization to better understand the data and then we are going to conceive a baseline model (lgbm) which we are going to optimize using GridSearchCV and Hyperopt.
(We used some starter notebooks from the Kaggle community)
